Employee management is a simple Python program that uses the **CSV module** to read, write and update a CSV file.

## How to use the program?
Using the program is very simple. Just download or clone the repository to your local machine and execute the `menu.py` file using the Python version you have installed.

To download this program, click the Code button beside Add File and select `Download ZIP`.

## Improvements?
Currently, the program uses the CSV Module to handle reads and writes to a CSV file. Although this works fine for small datasets, larger datasets should use NumPy and Pandas as it's exponentially better.

I'm using the CSV module because we had to use that for this project. We'll be dealing with small datasets, so they shouldn't dramatically impact performance.
